''' Why is encapsulation considered a pillar of object-oriented programming (OOP)? '''

''' Encapsulation is a pillar of OOP because it hides data, restricting direct access 
and ensuring data integrity. It provides controlled access through getters and setters, 
enhancing security, modularity, and maintainability. Encapsulation prevents unintended 
modifications, enforces abstraction, and promotes code reusability, making software 
more robust and scalable. '''
