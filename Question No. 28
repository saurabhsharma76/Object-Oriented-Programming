''' Explain the use of access modifiers in Python classes '''

''' Access modifiers in Python classes control the visibility of class attributes and 
methods, ensuring encapsulation and data security. Python provides three types:

#Public (public_var) – Accessible from anywhere, inside or outside the class.
#Protected (_protected_var) – Indicated by a single underscore (_), suggesting that 
it should not be accessed directly but can be inherited and used in subclasses.
#Private (__private_var) – Indicated by double underscores (__), restricting direct 
access outside the class. It undergoes name mangling (_ClassName__private_var), 
preventing accidental modification. '''
