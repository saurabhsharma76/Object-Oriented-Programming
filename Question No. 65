''' What is the purpose of the __getitem__() method in Python? Provide an example '''

''' The __getitem__() method allows objects to use indexing (obj[index]) like lists, 
tuples, or dictionaries. It is commonly implemented in custom classes to make them 
behave like sequences or mappings. '''

class CustomList:
    def __init__(self, items):
        #store list elements
        self.items = items

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        #enables indexing and slicing
        return self.items[index]

#creating an instance
cl = CustomList([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])

#accessing elements using indexing
print(cl[1])
print(cl[3])

#using slicing
print(cl[1:4])
