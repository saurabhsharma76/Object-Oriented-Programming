''' Explain the importance of abstraction in object-oriented programming '''

'''Importance of Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Hides Implementation Details – Abstraction allows users to focus on essential features 
without worrying about underlying complexities.
Enhances Code Reusability – Developers can create generic abstract classes that multiple 
subclasses can inherit and implement differently.
Improves Maintainability – Changes in implementation do not affect the overall program 
structure, making maintenance easier.
Encourages Modularity – By separating abstract definitions from concrete implementations,
code is more structured and modular.
Ensures Security – Data and implementation details are hidden, preventing unauthorized 
access and misuse.
Supports Interface-Based Design – Abstract classes define interfaces that different 
classes can implement, ensuring consistency in large applications.'''
