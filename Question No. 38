''' How are abstract methods different from regular methods in Python? '''

''' **Abstract methods** in Python are declared in abstract classes using the `@abstractmethod` 
decorator from the `abc` module, without implementation. Subclasses must override them. **Regular 
methods** have complete definitions and can be inherited or overridden optionally. Abstract methods 
enforce implementation, while regular methods provide direct functionality. '''
