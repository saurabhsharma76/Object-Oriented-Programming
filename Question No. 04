''' What are *args and **kwargs '''

''' *args allows a function to accept any number of positional arguments as a tuple, 
while **kwargs allows it to accept any number of keyword arguments as a dictionary. 
*args is used for flexible inputs, and **kwargs helps handle named arguments dynamically, 
making functions more adaptable and reusable. '''
