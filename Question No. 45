''' How does polymorphism improve code readability and reusability? '''

''' Polymorphism enhances code readability and reusability by allowing different 
classes to use a common interface while implementing their own specific behavior. 
This eliminates the need for conditional statements (like if-else) to check object 
types, making the code cleaner, modular, and easier to maintain. '''
