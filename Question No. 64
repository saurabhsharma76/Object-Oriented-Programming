''' Explain the usage of the __add__() method in Python classes. Provide an example '''

''' The __add__() method is a special (dunder) method that overloads the + operator in 
Python. When you use object1 + object2, Python internally calls object1.__add__(object2). 
This allows custom classes to define addition behavior. '''

class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        #defines how two objects are added
        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Point({self.x}, {self.y})"

#creating two Point objects
p1 = Point(2, 3)
p2 = Point(4, 5)

#using the + operator
result = p1 + p2
print(result)
