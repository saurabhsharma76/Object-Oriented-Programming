''' Explain method overriding in Python '''

''' Method overriding in Python allows a child class to provide a specific implementation 
of a method already defined in its parent class. The overridden method in the child class 
must have the same name and parameters as in the parent. It enables dynamic method 
dispatch, supporting polymorphism in OOP. '''
