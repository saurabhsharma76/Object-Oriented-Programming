''' How does Python achieve polymorphism through method overriding? '''

''' Polymorphism in Python allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a 
method that is already defined in its superclass. This is achieved through method 
overriding, where a subclass redefines a method from the parent class while maintaining 
the same name and parameters. '''
