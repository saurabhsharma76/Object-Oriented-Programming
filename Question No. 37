''' What is abstraction in Python? How is it implemented? '''

''' Abstraction in Python is an OOP concept that hides implementation details and only 
exposes essential functionalities. It is implemented using abstract classes and abstract 
methods, provided by the abc module. An abstract class cannot be instantiated and must 
have at least one abstract method, which subclasses must implement.'''

    def make_sound(self):
