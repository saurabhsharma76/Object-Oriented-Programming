''' Describe how Python supports polymorphism with duck typing? '''

''' Python follows the duck typing principle, which means an object's behavior 
determines its usability, rather than its explicit type. If an object implements a 
method, Python allows its use without enforcing inheritance or specific types.

Instead of checking an object's class, Python focuses on whether the object has the 
required method. This allows different objects to be used interchangeably if they 
provide the same method.
