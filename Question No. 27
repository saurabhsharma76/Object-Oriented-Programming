''' What is encapsulation in OOP? '''

''' Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the practice of bundling 
data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class) while restricting 
direct access to some details. It enhances data security by using access modifiers 
like `private`, `protected`, and `public`, allowing controlled interaction with the 
class. '''
