''' How do you achieve encapsulation in Python? '''

''' Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting direct access to class 
attributes and methods, allowing controlled access through getter and setter methods. 
Python uses access modifiers to define variable visibility:

Public (variable) – Accessible anywhere.
Protected (_variable) – Suggests internal use; can be accessed but not recommended.
Private (__variable) – Name-mangled to prevent direct access (_ClassName__variable).
