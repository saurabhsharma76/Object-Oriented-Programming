''' Define polymorphism in OOP? '''

''' Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) allows objects of different 
classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface 
to represent different underlying data types. This is achieved through method overloading,
method overriding, and operator overloading, enhancing flexibility and reusability in 
code design. '''
