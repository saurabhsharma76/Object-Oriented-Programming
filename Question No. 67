''' What is the purpose of a getter method in Python? Provide an example demonstrating
the use of a getter method using property decorators '''

''' A getter method is used to retrieve the value of a private attribute in a 
controlled manner. It helps enforce encapsulation by restricting direct access to 
attributes while allowing validation or modification before returning the value.
In Python, property decorators (@property) can be used to define getter methods.

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        #private attribute
        self._name = name  
        self._age = age    

    @property
    def age(self):
        #getter method for age
        #returns the private attribute
        return self._age  

#creating an instance
p = Person("Alice", 25)

#a age using the getter method
print(p.age)
