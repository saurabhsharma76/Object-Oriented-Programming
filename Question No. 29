''' What is inheritance in OOP? '''

''' Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a mechanism where a child class 
derives properties and behaviors from a parent class. It promotes code reusability and 
hierarchy. The child class can inherit, override, or extend functionalities, enabling 
efficient programming. Python supports single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, and 
hybrid inheritance. '''
